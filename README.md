# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

By using pure **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, and **D3.js**, I created 2 webpages with information about UFO sightings in the US and Canada. The webpages both include a table dynamically based upon a dataset of UFO sightings. The webpage titled "UFO Finder Part I" incorporated 1 filter allowing a person to search by date. A snippet of the webpage is shown below.

The webpage title "UFO Finder Part II" incorporated 5 filters, allowing a person to filter by date, city, state, country, and/or shape of the UFO sighting. A snippet of the webpage is shown below.
